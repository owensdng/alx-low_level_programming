Understanding Doubly Linked Lists:
Start by understanding what a doubly linked list is. A doubly linked list is a data structure in which each element (node) contains a value and two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and one pointing to the next node. This structure allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal in both directions.
